Linked List Algorithms (C++ Collection)

A curated set of C++ implementations covering essential Linked List and Doubly Linked List operations.
Each file focuses on a single concept so you can learn, test, or reuse code easily.

📂 Files Included
🔗 Singly Linked List

insert.cpp — Insert nodes (beginning/end/middle)

display().cpp — Display the linked list

search.cpp — Search for a value in the list

reverse.cpp — Reverse the linked list

middle.cpp / Middle of Linked list.cpp — Find the middle node

delect_pos.cpp — Delete a node at a specific position

delectMiddle.cpp — Delete the middle node

link.cpp — Basic linked list creation

Linked Cycle.cpp — Detect cycle / loop in a linked list

🟣 Linked List Operations (Stack-like)

push&pop.cpp — Push and pop operations using linked list

🔁 Circular Linked List

Linked Cycle.cpp — Cycle detection / circular list logic

🔀 Doubly Linked List

dubbly.cpp — Basic doubly linked list operations

🚀 How to Run

Compile any file individually:

g++ filename.cpp -o run
./run


Example:

g++ reverse.cpp -o reverse
./reverse

🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed for:

Practicing core linked list techniques

Quick reference for common operations

Learning pointer-based data structures in C++

Interview preparation
